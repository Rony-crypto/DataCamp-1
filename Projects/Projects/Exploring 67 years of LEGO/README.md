# Project Description
The [Rebrickable](https://rebrickable.com/downloads/) database includes data on every LEGO set that ever been sold; the names of the sets, what bricks they contain, what color the bricks are, etc. It might be small bricks, but this is big data! In this project, you will get to explore the Rebrickable database. To do this you need to know your way around pandas dataframes and it's recommended that you take a look at the courses [pandas Foundations](https://github.com/VaibhavSachaa/DataCamp/tree/master/Data%20Scientist%20with%20Python/Course%208%20-%20Pandas%20Foundation) and [Manipulating DataFrames with pandas](https://github.com/VaibhavSachaa/DataCamp/tree/master/Data%20Scientist%20with%20Python/Course%209%20-%20Manipulating%20DataFrames%20with%20pandas).
