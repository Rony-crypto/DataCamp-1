# Course Description
This course extends Intermediate Python for Data Science to provide a stronger foundation in data visualization in Python. The course provides a broader coverage of the Matplotlib library and an overview of Seaborn (a package for statistical graphics). Topics covered include customizing graphics, plotting two-dimensional arrays (e.g., pseudocolor plots, contour plots, images, etc.), statistical graphics (e.g., visualizing distributions & regressions), and working with time series and image data.
